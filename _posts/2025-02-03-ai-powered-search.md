title: AI Powered Search
---

I remember that at some point every new member of Allegro Search Team was handed out with a copy of "Relevant Search", whether it was an engineer or a product manager - ‚Äúthis is the state of the art manual for building ecommerce search - you should know that!‚Äù. Years passed, "Relevant Search" was still standing on our shelf but AI race changed the search landscape quite significantly. As always, there are a lot of resources scattered all over the internet, some of them offer high quality case studies from major companies, but there is a lot of bullshit (now even AI generated bullshit üôÇ). Anyone who was digging through this ocean of info chaos would agree that having it all in one compact book is priceless.

It seems that also author of Relevant Search came to similar conclusions. He started to chase the moving target known as AI in Search some time ago. Long story short the wait is over Doug Turnbull with support of Trey Grainger and üü¢ Max Irwin finally finished work on new book - "AI-Powered Search". 

I had the privilege of working on the final shape of this book as a technical reviewer of a few first chapters. I just received my reviewer's (paper) copy (I still prefer technical books on paper) and started to read through the book. It seems that "Relevant Search" was finally rewritten and we are once again handed out with the missing manual to state of the art ecommerce search ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Go check it out, it is already possible to order this book in your favourite online bookstore.
