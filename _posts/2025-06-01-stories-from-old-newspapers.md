title: Stories from old newspapers
---

During my sabbatical I allowed myself to dive into a few things which I was always interested in. Inspired by several cool social media profiles created by former Allegro colleagues, I decided to use this medium to share my findings related to local, historical newspapers (Pozna≈Ñ!). 

By the end of 2024 I've started [@historie_ze_starych_gazet](https://www.instagram.com/historie_ze_starych_gazet/) IG profile. I am not sure if I can say that I was successful here, but I've already managed to fulfill my initial goal - reaching 1k of followers. 

What are conclusions so far (please keep in mind, that I am amateur in subject of Social Media):
- content creation and social media is a damn hard job 
- instagram is no longer about photos, reels are the king
- consistency is super important - as always
- building followers base is something different than building community
- meta moderation can be quite unpredictable, especially if you deal with history and sensitive topics (eg. anti-semitism, women rights)

Reading through all these newspapers I've learned that although we are very similar to people and situations described there, the world has changed quite a lot (thankfully!) in my opinion... for the better. Violating privacy of individuals, anti-semitism, women rights, hate speech this is a not uncommon even on the first pages of 1920s/1930s newspapers. We often complain about political correctness in modern media, looking back you can better understand how bad things can be.

I am currently counting down to start of WWII ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, if you want to witness the tension of last days, presented through the lens of Dziennik Poranny (one of Pozna≈Ñ's newspapers) please feel free to take a look at @historie_ze_starych_gazet (Polish language fluency required).
