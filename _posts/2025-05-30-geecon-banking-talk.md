title: Private banking GeeCON 2025 talk
---

Two weeks ago I had a chance to speak at geecon (Krak√≥w). Topic? My small, very special banking project. How to teach children about foundations of modern personal finance? This was a question which we asked ourselves 5 years ago together with my wife. It sparked a pretty cool software product - a very private banking system for our three children, with an astonishing 10% interest rate - at least at the time when the service was launched üòÄ. In this lighting talk I've summarized this experiment and shown that even such a small project, proofs well known truths in software and product development: product evolves over time, users habits are hard to change, selection of technology is crucial in terms of maintenance costs and last but not least compound interest are really powerful. 

I had a lot of fun preparing this talk (eg. looking for source code of its original Java/Spring/Hibernate version ü§™), it was superb to see a room filled with people and get some positive feedback after the talk. 

Thank you GeeCON for having me! Promise to bring something interesting next time.
