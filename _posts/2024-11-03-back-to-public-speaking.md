title: Public speaking is fun again
---

I really like public speaking. This may sound weird for those who know me better, but I have a lot of satisfaction from the entire process of preparation, rehearsals and then delivering the talk for the first time. My last conference talk took place in 2021, when I was a remote speaker at DevDays which took place "in" Vilnius. Talking to an empty room, without any feedback from the audience was not funny at all. After this, I thought maybe this conference-speaking thing ended for me. 

In April I had a chance to deliver a fully offline (hardcore oldschool stuff, audience and microphone... etc.) talk about the future of Allegro search engine. It was fun, so... I thougth maybe it's time to try once again.

I came back to a topic which I had in mind since 2020, ‚ÄúWhere do old programmers go?‚Äù, submitted a talk proposal to one of my favorite and the best Polish conferences - Allegro Tech Meeting. 

How does this story end? Well it seems that this talk was voted best lighting talk of the day. Damn proud, so proud that I decided to post this here üôÇ. Thank you ATM crowd!

If you find this topic interesting let me know.
