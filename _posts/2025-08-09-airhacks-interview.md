title: Highlights from airhacks.fm interview
---

The history of this conversation goes back to 2022 when I've decided to stop using Twitter. So, I've logged out and decided not to come back. 3 years later, I took a glimpse into my account to check what was left from Twitter after its transformation to X. The only interesting finding was a DM from Adam Bien, with an invitation to his airhack podcast ðŸ˜€. I don't consider myself as a person worth a podcast, but when we finally met in person during GeeCON 2025 - we finally agreed to get this podcast done.

The podcast ["Adam && Adam == true"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1VRNFvUgBN3oULjFDza2ur) on airhacks.fm features a conversation covering my journey in programming, software development and cloud architecture, as well as some reflections on technology evolution and effective engineering. It is more of a rant than anything else, but I really enjoyed this conversation. I hope you will also find something interesting there. 

We are talking about Turbo Pascal (my first programming language), engaging in the [demoscene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2Md7dvxIe8) ([floppy disk swaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Ke8DWwcuw) by standard mail, writing assembly code). During prep for this podcast I've found the source code of my 64kb intro, called KlÄ…twa (Curse in Polish). KlÄ…twa is now available on [github](https://github.com/maneo/klatwa), so if you don't remember how assembly code looks... go and take a look ðŸ˜€. It was really fun to get back to the early days.

What else is covered in the podcast? 
* Old stories from 2007/2008 - Netbeans dream team activities and PoznaÅ„ JUG events.
* Building digital libraries in Poland with Java Enterprise'y stack.
* Allegro and Large-Scale Search Infrastructure
* Standards vs APIs, cloud native apps / serverless and maintenance of JEE in long run
* Some of my public speaking related projects, like the private banking system I was talking about at GeeCON 2025.

Below you can find a poster from Netbeans days 2008, which we are talking more about in the [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1VRNFvUgBN3oULjFDza2ur).

Main learnings from this undertaking:
* Standard vs API - even most stable API is just an API from one vendor.
* I need to get better mic, audio quality on my side is poor.
* Suprisingly large part of this interview was dedicated to my pre-Allegro past, it seems that I really enjoyed work in PSNC ðŸ˜€
